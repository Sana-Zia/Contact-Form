# Contact Form Project

## Overview
This project is a simple and modern Contact Form created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes form validation and a clean UI with decorative background effects.

## Features
- Responsive and clean design
- JavaScript form validation (name and email)
- Error messages for invalid inputs
- Decorative CSS background with gradient and blobs
- Hover effects for submit button

## Technologies Used
- HTML5 – Structure
- CSS3 – Styling and layout
- JavaScript – Form validation

## Project Structure
index.html    → Main file  
style.css     → CSS styling (if separated)  
script.js     → JavaScript validation (if separated)  

## How It Works
1. User fills in Full Name, Email, Subject, and Message.
2. JavaScript checks:
   - Name must be at least 2 characters
   - Email must be in correct format
3. Errors are shown if inputs are invalid.
4. If valid, form submits successfully.

## Future Improvements
- Add backend (PHP/MySQL) to save form data
- Show success message after submission
- Advanced validation for subject and message
